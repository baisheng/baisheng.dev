序:现在这篇文章让我读后有过前所未有的震撼&#8230;&#8230;

A woman saw three old men sitting in her front yard.She said,&#8221;I don&#8217;t think I know you,but you must be hungry.Please come in and have something to eat.&#8221;  
一个妇人看见有三位老人坐在她家的前院里,就对他们说:&#8221;我想我不认识你们,但你们一定饿了吧.那就请进屋吃点东西吧!&#8221;

We do not go into a house together.&#8221; they replied.  
&#8220;我们不会一起进屋的.&#8221;三个人异口同声地答道.  

  
&#8220;Why is that ?&#8221; she wanted to know.  
&#8220;为什么?&#8221;妇人感到奇怪.

One of the old men explained:&#8221;His mame is Wealth,this is Success, and I am love,&#8221;Then he added,&#8221;Now go in and discuss with your husband which one of us you want in your home.,&#8221;  
其中一位老人解释道:&#8221;他叫&#8217;财富&#8217;,这是&#8217;成功&#8217;,而我则是&#8217;爱&#8217;,&#8221;他补充道,&#8221;现在你回屋去,和你丈夫商量一下,愿意让我们中的哪一位进去.&#8221;

Then the woman went in and told her husband what was said .Her husband said ,&#8221;Let&#8217;s invite wealth. Let hm come and fill our home with Wealth !&#8221;His wife disagreed,&#8221;My dear made a suggestion:&#8221;Would it be better to invite Love ? Our home will then be filled with love!&#8221; &#8220;Let&#8217;s take our daughter&#8217;s advice ,&#8221;said the father.  
妇女便进屋把一切告诉她丈夫.她丈夫说:&#8221;我们请&#8217;财富&#8217;吧,让他进来,使我们的家充满财富!&#8221;妻子不同意:&#8221;我说亲爱的,我们为什么时候不邀请&#8217; 成功&#8217;呢?&#8221;这时,他们的女儿建议道:&#8221;请&#8217;爱&#8217;会不会更好呢?那样我们的家就会充满爱了!&#8221;"我们听女儿的吧.&#8221;父亲说.

So the woman went out and asked,&#8221; Which one of you is Love? Please come in and the our guest.&#8221;Love got up and started walking toward the house. The other two also got up and followed him.Sur-prised,the lady asked Wealth and Success:&#8221;I only invited Love. Why are you coming in?&#8221;  
于是,妇女便出来问道:&#8221;请问哪一位是&#8217;爱&#8217;呀?请进屋做客吧!&#8217;爱&#8217;站了起来,向屋子走去.另外两个人也站了起来,跟在&#8217;爱&#8217;的身后.妇女很惊讶,便问&#8217;财富&#8217;和&#8217;成功&#8217;:&#8221;我只邀请了&#8217;爱&#8217;怎么你们也来了呢?&#8221;

The old men replied together:&#8221;If you had in-vited Wealth or Success,the other two of us would have stayed out ,but since you invited Love ,wher-ever HE goes ,we go with him .Wherever there is Love,there is also Wealth and Suc-cess.  
三位老人再次异口同声地答道:&#8221;如果你邀请&#8217;财富&#8217;或是&#8217;成功&#8217;,我们中的另外两个人就会待在外面,但是既然你邀请了&#8217;爱&#8217;,无论他走到哪里,我们都会跟着他.因为哪里有&#8217;爱&#8217;,哪里就会有&#8217;财富&#8217;和&#8217;成功!&#8217;
